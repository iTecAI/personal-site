I was the volunteer director for the first [MetroHacks](https://metrohacks.dev/ "MetroHacks Website") Women 12-hour hackathon in NYC in early 2020.
I directed a team of students to organize the event, find sponsors, and advertise to participants. Additionally, I worked with the developers of the
wider organization in order to overhaul their website and fix several outstanding software issues.
