I am an active voting member of [Computer Science House](csh.rit.edu "CSH Public Site"), a student organization that focuses on teaching
advanced computing concepts to its members, and allows us to experiment with DevOps work, enterprise-grade server equipment, embedded systems, and many
other topics. Additionally, it provides a strong network of connections to alumni in the industry.
